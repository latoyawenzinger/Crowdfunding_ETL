# Crowdfunding_ETL


This project utilizes an extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline to combine multiple data sources. Python and Pandas was used to **extract** and **transform** that data into four clean CSV files: 

   **- Category**
   **- Subcategory**
   **- Contacts**
   **- Campaign**
  
  
SQL was used to **load** each table to a Postgres database
